In this step of the setup, I configured the osTicket help desk system by creating multiple agents with distinct roles and permissions. Within the Admin Panel, I navigated to Agents → Add New Agent and created different user accounts such as Autavious Roberts (Admin User), Jane Doe (Support Technician), and John Doe (Help Desk Agent). Each user was assigned to specific departments — like Support and SysAdmins — to organize ticket routing and escalation paths. By setting different roles and access levels, I ensured that administrators could manage and configure the system, while support agents could handle customer tickets efficiently. This configuration allows for structured collaboration across teams and effective ticket management throughout the osTicket system.

This image shows the administrator finalizing osTicket’s base setup — verifying that the system is online, establishing the help desk’s name and department structure, and ensuring the platform is ready for live ticket management. It’s a key step in confirming that the help desk environment is configured and functioning correctly on the local host.
